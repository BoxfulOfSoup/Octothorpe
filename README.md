>1. Another term for the # symbol (the hash sign or pound 
sign)
>2. A very cool word game featuring an octothorpe board (see definition 1)

A word game in which you must find the two vertical words, and two horizontal words, that make up the octothorpe. The 16 letters are split into 4 color coded categories, you can see what letters are in each category, but you must figure out the order yourself. Click the Octothorpe in the center to check your answer, if it is 100% click again to end the game.

The game includes a daily section and a random section; both are randomly generated but the daily section will remain the same as much as you play it and will be the same for all players with the same computer date.
